Usage: snp-pileup [OPTION...] <vcf file> <output file> <sequence files...>

  -A, --count-orphans        Do not discard anomalous read pairs.
  -d, --max-depth=DEPTH      Sets the maximum depth. Default is 4000.
  -g, --gzip                 Compresses the output file with BGZF.
  -p, --progress             Show a progress bar. WARNING: requires additional
                             time to calculate number of SNPs, and will take
                             longer than normal.
  -P, --pseudo-snps=MULTIPLE Every MULTIPLE positions, if there is no SNP,
                             insert a blank record with the total count at the
                             position.
  -q, --min-map-quality=QUALITY   Sets the minimum threshold for mapping
                             quality. Default is 0.
  -Q, --min-base-quality=QUALITY   Sets the minimum threshold for base quality.
                             Default is 0.
  -r, --min-read-counts=READS   Comma separated list of minimum read counts for
                             a position to be output. Default is 0.
  -v, --verbose              Show detailed messages.
  -x, --ignore-overlaps      Disable read-pair overlap detection.
  -?, --help                 Give this help list
      --usage                Give a short usage message
